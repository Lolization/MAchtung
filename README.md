# MAchtung
Machtung is a combination of two projects: PyUI & Achtung

## PyUI
PyUI is made to be a package in python, used as an extension to Pygame.
Using this package you will be able to use Views in Pygame freely.
PyUI allows you to use functions as set_on_click_listeners, and handles all Pygame events for you, 
allowing you to use Pygame without having to worry about handling background Pygame aspects.

## Achtung
This is an Achtung game, resembling Curvefever.
When entering the game you are viewed with a login page:
